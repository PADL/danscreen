## danscreen

`danscreen` is a command-line utility I wrote for my friend Dan. It does, somewhat inflexibly, one thing only: given a left/right monitor configuration on OS X, toggles between which monitor is the primary monitor, and positions the dock so that it is on the left or right edge of the new primary monitor.
